# IMDB Movies Data Analysis

**IMDB Movies Data Analysis – SQL Project**

This repository contains an SQL-based data analysis project focused on exploring and analyzing IMDB movie and director data.  
The project demonstrates the practical application of SQL concepts to solve real-world analytical and business-related problems in the movie industry.

---

## Project Overview

The IMDB Movies Data Analysis project aims to extract meaningful insights from structured movie and director data using SQL.  
The dataset consists of two relational tables: **Movies** and **Directors**, connected through a primary–foreign key relationship.

The project follows a complete analytics workflow including:
- Data exploration
- Data cleaning and validation
- Table joining
- Business-driven SQL analysis
- Insight generation

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **MySQL**
- **MySQL Workbench**
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**

### SQL Concepts Used
- **SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY**
- **GROUP BY, HAVING**
- **INNER JOIN**
- **Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, MAX)**
- **Subqueries**
- **String Filtering (LIKE, IN)**
- **Date Filtering**

---

## Dataset Structure

The analysis is performed using the following tables:

### Directors Table
- `id` – **Unique director ID (Primary Key)**
- `name` – **Director name**
- `gender` – **Gender code (0/2 = Male, 1 = Female)**
- `department` – **Department information**

### Movies Table
- `id` – **Movie ID**
- `original_title` – **Original movie title**
- `title` – **Movie title**
- `budget` – **Production budget**
- `revenue` – **Revenue generated**
- `popularity` – **Popularity score**
- `release_date` – **Release date**
- `vote_average` – **Average rating**
- `vote_count` – **Number of votes**
- `director_id` – **Director ID (Foreign Key)**

---

## Table Relationship & Data Merging Logic

- `directors.id` is used as the **Primary Key**
- `movies.director_id` is used as the **Foreign Key**
- Tables were logically merged using an **INNER JOIN**
- No physical changes were made to the original database

---

## Data Cleaning & Validation

- Checked **NULL values** in all critical columns.
- **Directors** table contained no NULL values.
- **Movies** table had minimal NULL values in non-critical columns.
- Duplicate records were checked using **GROUP BY** and **HAVING**.
- Dataset was validated before performing analysis.

---

## Business Questions Solved

- Total number of movies in the IMDB dataset
- Directors with specific names and naming patterns
- Count of female directors
- Identification of the 10th female director
- Top 3 most popular movies
- Top 3 most bankable movies using profit calculation
- Highest-rated movies since January 1, 2000
- Movies directed by a specific director
- Director with the most movies
- Most bankable director based on total profit

---

## Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- **Data filtering and cleansing (NULL handling)**
- **Multi-table joins and relational mapping**
- **Aggregation and grouping for trend analysis**
- **String and date manipulation**
- **Writing readable and optimized SQL queries**
- **Applying real-world business logic in SQL**

---

## Key Insights

- The dataset contains **47 movies** and **2349 directors**
- Only **150 female directors** were identified
- **Top 3 most popular movies**:
  - *Jurassic World*
  - *Captain America: Civil War*
  - *Avatar*
- Highest average vote since **January 1, 2000** is **7.6**
- **Gore Verbinski** directed the highest number of movies (**3 movies**)
- **James Cameron** is the most bankable director with total profit of **4,195,999,275**
- No movies directed by **Brenda Chapman** were found

---

## Business Recommendations

- Use **profit-based metrics** instead of revenue alone
- Invest in **bankable directors** with proven profitability
- Combine **popularity, ratings, and profit** for decisions
- Encourage **female director participation**
- Apply **data-driven analysis** early to reduce risk

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Improved **SQL querying and optimization skills**
- Hands-on experience with **relational databases**
- Strong understanding of **data cleaning and validation**
- Ability to translate data into **business insights**
- Job-ready skills for **Data Analyst / SQL Analyst** roles

---

## Career Relevance

This project reflects real-world SQL tasks in entry-level data analyst roles:
- Data exploration
- Data cleaning
- Reporting
- Insight generation
- Business problem-solving using SQL
